# Road Map - Snake Game 2
    I. Research and find correct source code
        - Research maze games in python and snake games in python
        - Research collisions in those games
        - Find and select snake game with simple collision definitions
    II. Run code/play game to evaluate source code âœ“
        - Run through the game to determine its rules
        - Identify key elements/objects in the game
        - Identify sections of source code responsible for objects and rules
    III. Plan additions to game 
        - Add an obstacle on game surface
        - Add "door" for player to enter through obstacle safely
        - Add additional features as necessary
    IV. Implement Additions to Game 
        - Make obstacle appear on screen
        - Make obstacal lethal for player to collide with
        - Make safe "door" object on obstacle for player to pass over
        - 
    V. Rerun code/replay game to evaluate changes and make additions
