# AnacondaCalebCone
A Classic Snake Game in Python.

Source: https://github.com/talent-campus/snake-game

The main goal of this project is to improve upon an existing version of the game Snake. Current features of this version include a larger and smaller "snake" character, and four user-selected skill levels. I want to change the colors of each feature, add sounds, and a timer. More ambitious goals involve changing the dimensions of the frame and presenting the game in a level format (where separate levels would be increasingly difficult due to speed).

# SnakeGame2CalebCone 
A Snake Game with Obstacles.

After working witht my first snake game and updating, size, graphics, speed, background music, and other features; I was disappointed in my results with changing the collisions in the game. Due to the first game's source code, I found it very challenging to achieve my main goal of adding obstacles/walls inside the game's frame. I researched collisions, and different python modules to see if I could accomplish my task with different code. I found a repository of a snake game using the turtle module, and found it much easier to implement changes. The goal "Snake Game 2" was to actually change some of the ways the game traditionally works.
