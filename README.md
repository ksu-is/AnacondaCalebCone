A Classic Snake Game in Python.

Source: https://github.com/talent-campus/snake-game

The main goal of this project is to improve upon an existing version of the game Snake. Current features of this version include a larger and smaller "snake" character, and four user-selected skill levels. I want to change the colors of each feature, add sounds, and a timer. More ambitious goals involve changing the dimensions of the frame and presenting the game in a level format (where separate levels would be increasingly difficult due to speed).
